	 * the budget only means anything if it spans time. An attempt count alone did not: nothing on the failure path
	 * delays, so three attempts were consumed in about two milliseconds and a blip destroyed the message.
	 *
	 * The window is deliberately short, because it is calibrated to a race and not to an outage. 32202 is thrown when
	 * Tahu's permit count is ahead of Paho's actualInFlight, and the two go back into step as soon as Paho finishes
	 * the acknowledgement it is already processing - microseconds, not seconds. Where the drift is structural rather
	 * than a race the condition never clears on its own, and where the client is simply not connected the drain's own
	 * isConnected() check handles it on the next pass; in neither case does a longer window help, it only holds up

	 * window: attempts stop at 3, and reaching 10 of them would take 4250ms of backoff. They are kept because they
	 * are the bounds that start to matter the moment the window or the backoff step is retuned - a shorter step
